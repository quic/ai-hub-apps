# Qualcomm® AI Hub Apps

The Qualcomm® AI Hub Apps are a collection of sample apps and tutorials to help deploy machine learning models on Qualcomm® devices.

Each app is designed to work with one or more models from [Qualcomm® AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/).

With this repository, you can...
* Explore apps optimized for on-device deployment of various machine learning tasks.
* View open-source app recipes for running [Qualcomm® AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/) on local devices.
* Find tutorials for end-to-end workflows

## Overview

### Supported runtimes
* [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)
* [ONNX](https://onnxruntime.ai/)
* Genie SDK (Generative AI runtime on top of [Qualcomm® AI Engine Direct SDK](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-sdk))

### Supported Deployment Targets
* Android 11 Red Velvet Cake & Newer, API v30+
* Windows 11

### Supported compute units
* CPU, GPU, NPU (includes [hexagon HTP](https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/qualcomm-innovators-development-kit/ai-resources-overview/ai-hardware-cores-accelerators))

### Chipsets supported for NPU Acceleration
* [Snapdragon 8 Elite](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-elite-mobile-platform)
* [Snapdragon 8 Gen 3](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-gen-3-mobile-platform)
* [Snapdragon 8 Gen 2](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-gen-2-mobile-platform)
* [Snapdragon 8 Gen 1](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-gen-1-mobile-platform)
* [Snapdragon 888/888+](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-888-5g-mobile-platform)
* ... and all other [Snapdragon® chipsets supported by the QAIRT SDK](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-63442-50/overview.html#supported-snapdragon-devices)

_Weight and activation type required for NPU Acceleration:_
* Floating Point: FP16 (All Snapdragon® chipsets with Hexagon® Architecture v69 or newer)
* Integer : INT8 (All Snapdragon® chipsets)

__NOTE: These apps will run without NPU acceleration on non-Snapdragon® chipsets.__
