# Super Resolution Sample App

This sample app upscales images. The original image is displayed until the "run model" button is clicked. Once the model finishes running, an upscaled image is shown.

The app aims to showcase best practices for using **TF Lite** for model inference on Android devices.

## Prerequisites
1. Clone this repository **with [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com) enabled.**
2. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). **Version 2023.1.1 or newer** is required.
3. [Enable USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on your Android device.


## Build the APK

1. Download or export a [compatible model](#compatible-ai-hub-models) from [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models).
2. Copy the `.tflite` file to `src/main/assets/<your_model>.tflite`
3. In [../gradle.properties](../gradle.properties), modify the value of `superresolution_tfLiteModelAsset` to the name of your model file (`<your_model>.tflite`)
4. Open **the PARENT folder (`android`) (NOT THIS FOLDER)** in Android Studio, run gradle sync, and build the `SuperResolution` target.

## Supported Hardware (TF Lite Delegates)

By default, this app supports the following hardware:
* [Qualcomm Hexagon NPU -- via QNN](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-sdk)
* [GPU -- via GPUv2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu)
* [CPU -- via XNNPack](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack/README.md)

Comments have been left in [TFLiteHelpers.java](../tflite_helpers/TFLiteHelpers.java) and [AIHubDefaults.java](../tflite_helpers/AIHubDefaults.java) to guide you on how to add support for additional TF Lite delegates that could target other hardware.


## AI Model Requirements

### Model Runtime Formats
- TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)

### I/O Specification

| INPUT | Description | Shape | Data Type
| -- | -- | -- | --
| Image | An RGB image | [1, Input Height**, Input Width**, 3] | float32 or uint8 (zero point of 0, scale of 1 / 255)

| OUTPUT | Description | Shape | Data Type
| -- | -- | -- | --
| Image | An Upscaled RGB Image | [ 1, Output Height**, Output Width**, 3 ] | float32 or uint8 (zero point of 0, scale of 1 / 255)

** Any width / height is supported. The input image will be resized to fit the network.

## Compatible [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models)

The below is a non-exhaustive list of [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models) that should be compatible.

**Not every model has been individually tested with this app**. Please file an issue or reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/qualcomm-ai-hub/shared_invite/zt-2j76uzoye-Xya17vQESuxrWTKEwK2uMQ) if you find a model in this list with app compatibility issues.

Please download the TFLite asset. Variants `float` and `w8a8` are both supported by the app.

- [ESRGAN](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/esrgan)
- [QuickSRNetLarge](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/quicksrnetlarge)
- [QuickSRNetMedium](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/quicksrnetmedium)
- [QuickSRNetSmall](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/quicksrnetsmall)
- [Real-ESRGAN-General-x4v3](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/real_esrgan_general_x4v3)
- [Real-ESRGAN-x4plus](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/real_esrgan_x4plus)
- [SESR-M5](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/sesr_m5)
- [XLSR](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/xlsr)

A good model to start with is QuickSRNetSmall-Quantized, which strikes a good
balance between speed and numerical performance.

## Replicating an AI Hub Profile / Inference Job

Each AI Hub profile or inference job, once completed, will contain a `Runtime Configuration` section.

Modify [TFLiteHelpers.java](../tflite_helpers/TFLiteHelpers.java) according to the runtime configuration applied to the job. **Comment stubs are included** to help guide you (search for `TO REPLICATE AN AI HUB JOB...`)

Note that if your job uses delegates other than QNN NPU, GPUv2, and TFLite, then you will also need to add support for those delegates to the app.
